## Banter App

A react web app and api for users to register on and text each other, built just for fun.
Built this within a few weeks of learning react for the first time, so don't judge too harshly lol.

To run this project, clone the repo then run

## npm install --save

first in the base directory and again in the /public directory.

Start the express server, by running this command in the base directory

## node index

Start the development server for react by running this command in the /public directory

## npm start

Voila! The app is ready. To view it, open (http://localhost:8001).
