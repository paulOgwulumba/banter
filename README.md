## Banter App

A react web app and api for users to register on and text each other, built just for fun.
_Built this within a few weeks of learning react for the first time, so don't judge too harshly lol._

To run this project, clone the repo then run this command in the base directory and again in the __/public__ directory.:
````
npm install --save
````
Start the express development server, by running this command in the base directory:
````
npm run dev
````
Start the development server for react by running this command in the __/public__ directory
````
npm start
````
Voila! The app is ready. To view it, open (http://localhost:8001).
